# ðŸš˜ Vehicle GPS tracker with TTGO-T-Beam
### ESP32 + GPS + LoRa + GSM <sup>(optional)</sup>

This is an Arduino project for the **[TTGO T-Beam](https://github.com/LilyGO/TTGO-T-Beam)** ESP32 development board REV1.1, which has LoRa chip onboard.
**Cayenne** backend provides very nice web visualization, and also provides free Android/iPhone apps, where you can watch your car's position and indoor climate.
This project uses [Cayenne Low Power Payload](https://community.mydevices.com/t/cayenne-lpp-2-0/7510) packet format to transfer GPS coordinates and some car's indoor climate data.
It has adaptive packet rate, meaning that when the car moves, tracker starts to 'burst' sending packets to update the trajectory as precise as possible.
The **myDevices [Cayenne for LoRa](https://mydevices.com/cayenne/lora/)** connection is made through [The Things Network](https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/) LoRaWAN cloud.

You can find docs about Cayenne Low Power Payload (LPP) [here](https://mydevices.com/cayenne/docs/lora/#lora-cayenne-low-power-payload).

I'll try to describe whole project setup as best I can.

## 1. Backend setup

1. If you don't already have it, [set up The Things Network account](https://account.thethingsnetwork.org/register)
2. Create new Application in TTN [Applications Console](https://console.thethingsnetwork.org/applications)
3. Add a new device for your new TTN application and select **OTAA Activation Method**
4. Insert **Device EUI**, **Application EUI** and **App Key** to the .ino file in the Arduino project
Keep in mind the instructions in the file, e.g. \
This EUI must be in little-endian format, so least-significant-byte first. \
When copying an EUI from The Things dashboard, this means to reverse the bytes. \
For TTN issued EUIs the last bytes should be 0xD5, 0xB3,0x70. \
   
5. Upload sketch to your board, you can program the T-Beam using the [Arduino ESP32](https://github.com/espressif/arduino-esp32) board `Heltec_WIFI_LoRa_32`
6. In your TTN application, in section **Payload formats** select `Cayenne LPP`
7. In **Integrations** section, select `Cayenne`
8. Fill **Process ID** (choose any name you prefer), select **Default Access Key** and click on **Add integration**
9. [Log in to myDevices Cayenne](https://cayenne.mydevices.com/), on the top click on `+` and enter project name
10. Click on **Add new** -> **Device/Widget** -> **LoRa** -> **The Things Network** -> **Cayenne LPP**
11. Choose your **Name** and fill out **DevEUI** (copy **Device EUI** from [TTN Console](https://console.thethingsnetwork.org/)). Then select **Activation Mode** -> **Already Registered**, **Tracking** -> **This device moves**. Click **Add device**.
12. If your tracker already sent any data to TTN, you'll see bunch of data fields. You can drag them to your Cayenne project.
13. Install the **Cayenne** mobile app to your Android/iPhone.

#### That's it ðŸ˜ƒ

### Cayenne Screenshot

This is how it will look like when data is received by TTN and Cayenne.

### Cayenne data fields

- After these steps, you will see these data fields in Cayenne Dashboard:

![Cayenne data fields sent by Tracker](images/cayenne-data-fields.png)

> Note: In GPS field, there is also **GPS altitude** information available.

Optional fields, you can choose to send them in the program:

- **Analog Input (5)**: Battery voltage (in volts)
- **Analog Input (6)**: If tracker is moving, this field is **GPS speed**, in km/h
- **Analog Input (7)**: Number of **satellites**, that the GPS module currently 'sees'
- **Analog Input (8)**: Approximate tracker's **altitude** calculated from barometric air pressure

## 2. Wiring

Connect the BME/BMP280 module's `SDA` line to pin `21` and `SCL` to pin `22` on the TTGO.
If you want a more reliable data line (if the wires are long for some reason), you can add **pull-up resistors** on SDA and SCL lines.
Any value from 2.2k to 10k should be OK.
`VCC` of the module to `3V3` and `GND` to `GND` of course.

## 3. Libraries needed

- [ESP32 Core for Arduino](https://github.com/espressif/arduino-esp32/blob/master/docs/arduino-ide/boards_manager.md) (installation with Boards Manager)
- [TinyGPS++](https://github.com/mikalhart/TinyGPSPlus)
- [CayenneLPP](https://github.com/sabas1080/CayenneLPP)
- [BME280-I2C-ESP32](https://github.com/Takatsuki0204/BME280-I2C-ESP32)
	- Delete / uninstall original Adafruit BME280 library after installing this, otherwise it will cause conflicts!
- [Arduino-LMIC](https://github.com/matthijskooijman/arduino-lmic)

## TODO

- Split code with separate configuration file
- Split code so that BME280 can be taken out when not in use
- Update LMIC compatiblity to new MCCI LMIC library
- Debug TTN downlink messages, there are a lot of frames down. Seems to come from the library but need to test this first
